Dog age calculator

Calculate a puppyâ€™s age in dog years

- Write a function named calculateDogAge that:

    * takes 1 parameter: the dog's age in human years

    * calculates the dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years

    * outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your dog is NN years old in dog years!"


- Call the function three times with different sets of values

    * Add another parameter to the function that takes the conversion rate of human to dog years

2. Create the the `index.html` and `main.js` files in the appropriate directories

    * the `index.html` file will be in the `` directory

    * the `main.js` file will be in a directory called `scripts` containing only JavaScript scripts

        <!-- End of Body -->
        <script src="./scripts/main.js"></script>
