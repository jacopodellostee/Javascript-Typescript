# To CDN or not to CDN

**Author**: Jacopo Dell'Oste 

## Advantages of Using a CDN

1. **High Availability and Uptime**

   - CDNs ensure content availability even during traffic spikes or server failures by distributing the load across multiple servers.

2. **Increased Speed and Performance**

   - Content is delivered from the servers closest to the user, reducing latency and improving user experience.

3. **Load Distribution**

   - Prevents overloading the origin server by spreading requests across multiple edge servers.

4. **Scalability**

   - Makes it easier to handle web traffic growth without needing to rebuild infrastructure.

5. **Enhanced Security**

   - Many CDNs offer built-in protection against DDoS attacks, secure authentication, and TLS/SSL encryption.

6. **Real-Time Monitoring and Control**

   - Operators can view traffic statistics and redirect bandwidth where needed.

## Disadvantages of Using a CDN

1. **Additional Costs**

   - Premium CDN services charge based on bandwidth usage and number of requests.

2. **Support Issues**

   - Relying on third-party providers can lead to delays in resolving problems.

        + Downtime or technical issues require external coordination, slowing down recovery.

3. **Geographic Limitations**

   - If edge servers are not located near your main audience, latency might actually increase.

4. **Complex Configuration in Some Cases**

   - Setting up a CDN for dynamic content or personalized experiences may require advanced skills.

## When a CDN is Recommended

1. **E-Commerce**

    - An online store that ships worldwide needs fast loading times and protection from traffic spikes.

2. **Streaming Platform**

    - A video hosting site benefits from edge caching and optimizations to provide smooth streaming to users around the world.

## When a CDN Might Not Be Necessary

1. **Small Projects (Websites)**

    - A student portfolio website or school project typically has low traffic, a CDN would add complexity and unnecessary cost.

2. **Internal Business Application**

    - An internal corporate intranet application used by employees within a single building or over a VPN doesn't require geographic content distribution

        + An example could be the ITS's FAD
